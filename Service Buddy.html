	<h2><p class="no" id="App">Our Mission</p></h2>

	<p> The Service Buddy is a website to help organizations, individuals, and companies/institutions connect through the need for service animals by indiduals affected by health-related problems and/or disabilites.</p>
	<p>In our website, we have provided a variety of different tabs that provide different information. For finding service training locations, we have place to locate service animal training facilities across the globe. We also have an area for service animal trainers to submit notes or mistakes in training directly on site as well as area for signing up for volunteering, donations, and listing animals that are eligible for training and/or need resources. Finally, we provide information about the website, testomonials, and contact information, and more.</p>
<h2><p class="no" id="About">About Us</p></h2>
	<p>We are a team of 4 beginner programmers who have made this website to aid in the search for service animals. We were inspired by Paws for Cause and wanted to make our project centered around them. We hope you enjoy the fruits of our labor and fine some use for it. Below we have small introductions to all of us, so you can know us better!

<p>Hello, my name is Ryan Kyeremeh. I am a first year Animal Biology major who decided to dapple a bit into computer science. I was inspired to make this idea in order to aid the search for service animals and create a platform to see other service animals in training/working. I was the one who designed and created this website for the project. </p>
<p>
My name is Keshav Raviprakash and I am a junior Computer Systems major at the University of Georgia. I love learning to code and participating in hackathons. I decided to work on this project to help people who are at risk of strokes and also for creating connections for service dogs trained to deal with stroke-related events.	
</p>
<p>
	I'm Albert, a third year Computer Science major at Georgia Tech. I'm interested in machine learning and AI but am also exploring web development. On this project I explored ways to host the website and using APIs to potentially connect our website to a database. I was motivated to do this project for its help it can provide to service animals and their trainers.
