<img src="Website Images/Dog 1.jpg" width="250" height="241"><p class="petfolios">This is Froyo, he is an Alaskan Malumute/Husky mix. He has been a service animal for 4 years and was trained for 2. His owners love him and he is having a great time in the water!</p>
<img src="Website Images/Dog 2.jpg" width="350" height="260"><p class="petfolios">This beauty is Monica. She is a St.Bernard. She has been working for her current oweners for 5 years and was trained 1 years. She is about 6 years old and still is a puppy at heart. Look at that smile!</p>
<img src="Website Images/Dog 3.jpg" width="300" height="230"><p class="petfolios">This is Rowley, He's a bit of a grumpy old man. He's a retired service dog, has been living with his current family for 10 years now. He enjoys long naps on the porch and eating snowflakes.</p>
<img src="Website Images/notadog.jpg" width="200" height="241"><p class="petfolios">This is Oinks. He's a little different than the average service dog but he tries his best. He's still in training but once it's done, he will be given to a young girl by the name Susy! He's naturally photogenic as well!!</p>
